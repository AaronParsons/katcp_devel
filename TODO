Urgent things to do

  - sensors

    - ntp sync sensor. Done. Kindof. As an external 
      program. Use 
      
        ?job process  ...
      
      to spawn tmon, then run

        ?sensor relay ... 

      to capture the sensor data 

    - infrastructure sensors. Monitor power, temperature
      and fans. Semi done for roaches (power, fan - not
      temperature). Needs relay logic to grab the data
      from tcpborphserver (working on that). 

    - data path sensors. Not yet done. Could be done in
      two ways: Either on tcpborphserver, or polling 
      registers from kcs itself

    - lru sensors: not yet done, these sensors will have to 
      be part of a roach pool: As things get moved in or
      out of a pool, lru states should change
