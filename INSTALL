Notes
-----

This package provides the katcp library, utilities and a 
control server for the KAT 7 correlator, kcs. For the time
being kcs invokes the corr package (not included) to control
the correlator.

Configuration
-------------

There is no configure script. If you really want to change
some compiler flag (eg amount of debug information, floating point
support) edit Makefile.inc

Build
-----

Type 

  make 

at the top level directory. It is also possible
to run make in individual subdirectories. In that case
build the content of the katcp/ subdirectory first, as 
most other modules depend on it

Installation
------------

If you are only interested in the library (and maybe kcpcmd
or kcplog), enter the respective subdirectories and run make
install from there, eg 

  make -C katcp install
  make -C cmd install

Only if you want to run the full KAT7 correlator run 
make install at the top level, eg

  make install
